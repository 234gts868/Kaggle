GRU's were designed to be simpler and faster than LSTM's and in most cases produce equally good results and thus there is no clear winner.\n","\n","## In Depth Explanation\n","\n","* https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-gru-networks-2ef37df6c9be\n","* https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models/lecture/agZiL/gated-recurrent-unit-gru\n","* https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gated-recurrent-unit-networks/\n","\n","## Code Implementation"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"CVuIPslBb5Cw","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["%%time\n","with strategy.scope():\n","    # GRU with glove embeddings and two dense layers\n","     model = Sequential()\n","     model.add(Embedding(len(word_index) + 1,\n","                     300,\n","                     weights=[embedding_matrix],\n","                     input_length=max_len,\n","                     trainable=False))\n","     model.add(SpatialDropout1D(0.3))\n","     model.add(GRU(300))\n","     model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))\n","\n","     model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam',metrics=['accuracy'])   \n","    \n","model.summary()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"2PGYXTpFb5C2","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["model.fit(xtrain_pad, ytrain, nb_epoch=5, batch_size=64*strategy.num_replicas_in_sync)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"5D3BJ5wkb5C9","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["scores = model.predict(xvalid_pad)\n","print(\"Auc: %.2f%%\" % (roc_auc(scores,yvalid)))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"rkkJVWYfb5DE","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["scores_model.append({'Model': 'GRU','AUC_Score': roc_auc(scores,yvalid)})"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"FBocEKEyb5DJ","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["scores_model"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mNmHQdkLb5DO","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# **5.
